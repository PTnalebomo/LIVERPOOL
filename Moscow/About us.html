		<h1>History</h1>
		<p>The first significant date in the history of Liverpool is 1207, when King John of England granted a charter for<br> 
			a planned new town there. The town’s medieval growth was slow, but in the 18th century it expanded rapidly as a result of<br> 
			profitable trade with the Americas and the West Indies and became the second most important port in Britain. A major element in<br> 
			the general trading pattern was the Liverpool Triangle—the exchange of manufactured goods from the Mersey hinterland<br>
			 for slaves in West Africa who were in turn traded for sugar, molasses, spices, and other plantation crops in the West Indies.<br>
			The first dock in Liverpool was built in 1715. By the end of the century, four other docks had been established<br> 
			along the Mersey, so that the port outranked even London in dock space. In 1830 the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, the <br>
			first in England to link two major cities, was opened. A rail network providing easy and cheap access to all major British industrial<br> 
			centres was soon created, and steam ferry links between Liverpool and the Wirral, across the Mersey estuary, were established.<br> 
			This growth was accompanied by high levels of immigration from surrounding areas and from Ireland, especially during <br>and after the Irish Potato Famine (1845–49).
			By the beginning of the 20th century, Liverpool had become the centre of 7 miles (11 km) of docks extending along<br>
			 the Mersey from Hornby (1884) in the north to Herculaneum (1866) in the south. Additional improvements were made to the docks,<br> but after World War II Liverpool declined as an exporting and passenger port. That change can be attributed mainly to the decreasing<br> 
			 significance, in the economic life of Britain, of Liverpool’s industrial hinterland and its traditional trade with the United<br> States and West Africa. Low capital investment and unemployment in the docks intensified the situation.<br>
			Liverpool continues to exert a great degree of dominance over the surrounding metropolitan region. Although the traditional<br> 
			activities of transport, communication, distribution, and shipping have declined, they are still important in the economic<br> life of the city. The port, in addition to handling general cargo, has developed as a major facility for containerized shipping, and<br> in 2012 it became a terminus for cruise ships.
			Paramount among Liverpool’s important contributions to 20th-century popular culture were the Beatles, who emerged from the<br> Cavern (a nightclub that was part of the city’s musical scene in the 1960s) to become the world’s best-known rock group. Local<br> “performance” poets such as Roger McGough, Adrian Henri, and Brian Patten helped popularize poetry in the 1960s. And from the heyday of<br> the music hall to the radio comedy of Tommy Handley in the 1940s, Liverpudlians contributed to the British comedy tradition.<br> Tourism has grown in importance and includes a rise in interest for visiting locations associated with the Beatles.<br>
			Architectural landmarks include the 18th-century Town Hall and the 19th-century St. George’s Hall; the Neo-Gothic Anglican<br> 
			cathedral, founded in 1904 and completed in 1978; and the Roman Catholic Metropolitan Cathedral (1967), of strikingly modern design.<br> Tate Liverpool (a branch of the national Tate galleries), Merseyside County Museum and Library, the Walker Art Gallery, the Picton<br> Library, the International Slave Museum, and the University of Liverpool (chartered 1881) are among the many cultural institutions.<br> Liverpool also has a well-known symphony orchestra, and the city is home to two world-class professional football (soccer) teams (Everton and Liverpool FC).<br>
			 Area 43 square miles (112 square km). Pop. (2001) city, 439,473; urban agglom., 816,216; (2011) city, 466,415; urban agglom., 864,122.</p>
